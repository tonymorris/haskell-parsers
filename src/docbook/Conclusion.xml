  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <para>
    We have seen how to create a small parser library then use that library to create our own custom parsers. We did
    this by putting together parts to create more specialised parts.
    <footnote>
      <para>
        An industrial strength implementation of this type of parser library is Parsec.

  <para>
    This process is the essence of functional programming. It scales up to larger programs and demonstrates that
    functional programming is incredibly practical for solving real-world problems, much more so than traditional
    methods.
  </para>
  <para>
    We observed a programming pattern called the monadic model and we exploited Haskell's built-in support for it.
  </para>
  <para>
    What other types of problems fit this model? The answer(s!) to this question run deep, but that's for another day.
